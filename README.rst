Audiogen - Python 3
========

The ``audiogen_p3`` package provides time domain audio processing tools
using Python generators. 

Please note, this is a forked repository from "audiogen" by user "casebeer"
updated to work with Python3 since the original package has been unmaintained
for a few years. The only modifications to this package were to allow use
in Python 3. The remainder of the code is all original work by Christopher H. Casebeer

This makes some types of audio sample generation and processing pretty 
easy::

	# mix 440 Hz and 445 Hz tones to get 5 Hz beating
	beats = audiogen_p3.mixer(
		(audiogen_p3.tone(440), audiogen_p3.tone(445)),
		[(constant(1), constant(1)),]
	)

The actual samples won't be generated or stored in memory until they're 
actually consumed – for instance, when they're being written out to disk 
in a wave \file::

    with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
        audiogen_p3.sampler.write_wav(f, beats)

Generators' at-consumption-time computation also allows creating 
infinitely long output, e.g. to stream to speakers rather than a file on
disk::

    audiogen_p3.sampler.write_wav(sys.stdout, audiogen_p3.tone(440))

Or just::

    audiogen_p3.sampler.play(audiogen_p3.tone(440))

You can also use standard generator tools, e.g. the itertools module, to 
handle audio data::

	beep_silence = itertools.chain(audiogen_p3.beep(), audiogen_p3.silence(0.5))
	infinite_beeps = itertools.cycle(beep_silence)
    
    audiogen_p3.sampler.write_wav(sys.stdout, infinite_beeps)
	
Soundcard output
----------------

The easiest way to play directly to a soundcard output is to use the 
``audiogen_p3.sampler.play`` function, which will play your samples using 
PyAudio::

    import audiogen_p3
    import itertools
    import sys
    
    audiogen_p3.sampler.play(
        itertools.cycle(itertools.chain(audiogen_p3.beep(), audiogen_p3.silence(0.5)))
    )

Alternatively, you could write your wave data to ``stdout``, e.g. ``myaudio.py``::

    import audiogen_p3
    import itertools
    import sys
    
    audiogen_p3.sampler.write_wav(
        sys.stdout,
        itertools.cycle(itertools.chain(audiogen_p3.beep(), audiogen_p3.silence(0.5)))
    )

Then pipe to a command line audio player like Sox_::

    python myaudio.py | play -t wav -

Installation
------------

Install with::

    $ pip install audiogen_p3
    $ pip install --allow-external PyAudio --allow-unverified PyAudio PyAudio

PyAudio is optional. If it's not installed, playing audio via the soundcard with
``audiogen_p3.sampler.play()`` will not be available, but generating Wave files – 
including for piping to an external player, like ``sox`` – will work just fine. 

Note that to install PyAudio on Mac OS X, you'll need to first install `portaudio`::

    $ brew install portaudio
